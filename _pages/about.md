<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a 3nd-year PhD student of [AIM Lab](http://aim-nercms.whu.edu.cn/) at [National Engineering Research Center for Multimedia Software (国家多媒体软件工程技术研究中心)](http://multimedia.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (武汉大学)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), extremely fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Jun Chen and [Prof. Zheng Wang](https://wangzwhu.github.io/home/). Throughout my studies, I have been fortunate to collaborate closely with [Zhixiang Wang](https://lightchaserx.github.io/). I obtained my master's degree from Wuhan University of Technology, under the supervision of Prof. Xian Zhong.

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
