<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a 3nd-year PhD student of [AIM Lab](http://aim-nercms.whu.edu.cn/) at [National Engineering Research Center for Multimedia Software (国家多媒体软件工程技术研究中心)](http://multimedia.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (武汉大学)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), extremely fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Jun Chen and [Prof. Zheng Wang](https://wangzwhu.github.io/home/). I obtained my master's degree from Wuhan University of Technology, under the supervision of Prof. Xian Zhong.

My research interest includes privacy preservation and computer vision. I have published more than 10 papers at the international AI/CV conferences and journals.

[Balancing Privacy and Performance: A Many-in-One Approach for Image Anonymization]()

**Xuemei Jia**, Jiawei Du, Hui Wei, Ruinian Xue, Zheng Wang, Hongyuan Zhu, Jun Chen

<!-- [**Paper**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->
- This work addresses the limitations of existing privacy-preserving methods that rely on introducing external noise. A many-in-one strategy is realized through our Feature Recombining for Obfuscation (FRO) method, which combines identity-specific features from a knowledge pool to generate protected data instances.

[Complementary data augmentation for cloth-changing person re-identification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9802835/)

**Xuemei Jia**, Xian Zhong, Mang Ye, Wenxuan Liu, Wenxin Huang
-  To alleviate the reliance on rich data collection, we reinforce the feature learning process by designing powerful complementary data augmentation strategies, including positive and negative data augmentation.
